# FrequencyChecker

This is a simple program to check the frequency of a word or words in a song. 

A user must copy and paste the song lyrics into a text file. The text file should be in the same directory as the frequency_checker.py file. User input asks for the name of the file, the word or words that should be checked for their frequency, and for an estimate of any excess words that should be omitted from the calculations.
